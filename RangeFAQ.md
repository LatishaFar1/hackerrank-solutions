The range() function is often used in conjunction with loops to specify the number of times a loop should iterate. The range() function generates a sequence of numbers, starting from a start value and ending at an end value, with a specified step size. For example, the following code would print the numbers from 1 to 5:

```
for i in range(1, 6):
    print(i)
```

This would output the following to the console:

```
1
2
3
4
5
```

You can also specify a step size as the third argument to the range() function. For example, the following code would print the even numbers from 2 to 10:


``` 
for i in range(2, 11, 2):
    print(i)
This would output the following to the console:
```


```
2
4
6
8
10
```
