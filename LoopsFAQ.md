In Python, there are two types of loops: for loops and while loops.

A for loop is used to iterate over a sequence of items, such as a list or a string. The syntax for a for loop in Python is as follows:

```
for variable in sequence:
    # code to be executed
```

For example, if you have a list of numbers and you want to print each one to the console, you can use a for loop like this:

```
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

for number in numbers:
    print(number)
```

This would output the following to the console:

```
1
2
3
4
5
```

A while loop is used to repeat a block of code as long as a certain condition is true. The syntax for a while loop in Python is as follows:

```
while condition:
    # code to be executed

```

For example, if you want to print the numbers from 1 to 5 to the console, you can use a while loop like this:


```
count = 1

while count <= 5:
    print(count)
    count += 1
```


This would output the following to the console:

```
1
2
3
4
5
```
